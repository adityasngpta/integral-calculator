This program approximates the area beneath a curve using n rectangles (Riemann Sum in Calculus). Eventually, it will be possible to take the limit for the area as n → ∞. However, this code provides a good approximation and allows n to easily be scaled up for greater precision to the point where the right and left hand sums will converge.
