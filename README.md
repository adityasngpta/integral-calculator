# Integral Calculator
By Aditya Sengupta

As I continue to delve into the fascinating world of Calculus, I have come across an intriguing concept known as integration.
A useful way to approximate integration involves the use of rectangles. 
The program that I have created will estimate the area beneath a curve by utilizing n rectangles. 
While the precise calculation of the area beneath a curve requires the utilization of limits with infinite rectangles, I am still in the process of mastering this technique. 
Nonetheless, the program provides a reasonably accurate approximation. Furthermore, given that it is in the form of code, it can be conveniently scaled up to accommodate an increased number of rectangles.
